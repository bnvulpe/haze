## Using Haze on GitHub Pages

Setting up **Haze** on GitHub Pages is as simple as it gets!

**1. Create your own repository**

Click the **“Use this template”** button to create a new repository with a clean commit history based on the Haze template.

Once the repo is created, your Jekyll blog will usually be available immediately at: https://yourgithubusername.github.io
*(If you don’t see anything yet, complete step 2 to trigger a build).*

**2. Trigger the first site build**

Make a small change to the `_config.yml` file (or any file in the repository).  
This forces GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with Jekyll.

A few seconds later, your site should be visible at:
https://yourgithubusername.github.io


If it still hasn’t appeared, give it a few minutes (GitHub may take up to ~10 min on the initial build).
